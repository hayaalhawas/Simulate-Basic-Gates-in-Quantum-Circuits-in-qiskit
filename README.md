# Quantum Information Bootcamp: Logic Gates, Qiskit Circuits, and Bonus Task 🌟🔌

## Introduction 🌌

Logic gates, the bedrock of digital circuits, wield their significance across both classical and quantum computing realms. These gates empower us to manipulate binary inputs (0s and 1s) to unveil specific outputs, laying the foundation for intricate computations and discerning decision-making.

## Goals 🎯

- Immerse in practical Qiskit experience, a quantum computing framework in the limelight.
- Engineer AND, NAND, OR, and XOR logic gates, employing Qiskit's quantum circuits within distinct functions.
- Carve out custom gate objects for each logic gate through the magic of Qiskit.

## Task 📝

1. **AND Gate:**
   - **Function Artistry:**
     Craft a masterpiece in Qiskit's domain - a function dubbed `and_gate()` that conjures the spirit of an AND gate.
   - **Truth Table Enchantment:**

   | Input A | Input B | Output |
   |:-------:|:-------:|:------:|
   |    0    |    0    |    0   |
   |    0    |    1    |    0   |
   |    1    |    0    |    0   |
   |    1    |    1    |    1   |
   
   - **Gate Artistry:**
     Unveil your artistic prowess by fashioning a bespoke gate christened `AndGate`, a living embodiment of the circuit from `and_gate()` function.

2. **NAND Gate:**
   - **Function Mastery:**
     Channel your quantum prowess into Qiskit's canvas, painting a `nand_gate()` function.
   - **Truth Table Riddle:**

   | Input A | Input B | Output |
   |:-------:|:-------:|:------:|
   |    0    |    0    |    1   |
   |    0    |    1    |    1   |
   |    1    |    0    |    1   |
   |    1    |    1    |    0   |
   
   - **Gate Genesis:**
     Imbue life into `NandGate`, a handcrafted marvel, by weaving it from the threads of your `nand_gate()` function.

3. **OR Gate:**
   - **Function Elegance:**
     Unveil your quantum couture via Qiskit's tapestry, crafting a `or_gate()` function.
   - **Truth Table Symphony:**

   | Input A | Input B | Output |
   |:-------:|:-------:|:------:|
   |    0    |    0    |    0   |
   |    0    |    1    |    1   |
   |    1    |    0    |    1   |
   |    1    |    1    |    1   |
   
   - **Gate Sculpture:**
     Breathe life into `OrGate`, sculpting it from the clay of your `or_gate()` function.

4. **XOR Gate:**
   - **Function Wizardry:**
     Immerse in quantum wizardry, conjuring a `xor_gate()` function within Qiskit's realm.
   - **Truth Table Enigma:**

   | Input A | Input B | Output |
   |:-------:|:-------:|:------:|
   |    0    |    0    |    0   |
   |    0    |    1    |    1   |
   |    1    |    0    |    1   |
   |    1    |    1    |    0   |
   
   - **Gate Wizardry:**
     Breathe life into `XorGate`, conjuring it from the ether of your `xor_gate()` function.

## Submission 🚀

1. Fashion an artistic collage of well-rendered screenshots - your `and_gate()`, `nand_gate()`, `or_gate()`, and `xor_gate()` functions, all crafted in the tapestry of Qiskit.
2. Imbue the collage with the vibrancy of your quantum artistry.
3. Untangle the arcane threads of custom gate creation (`AndGate`, `NandGate`, `OrGate`, `XorGate`) in a dedicated narrative.
4. Offer your submission as a tribute, composed of screenshots, this enchanted README, and any further spellbinding sections you may conjure.

<!-- The README's allure may be augmented through diagrams, mystic images, or scripted fonts. Employ a harmonious style throughout this parchment. -->
